# AICa & CodaAI  
**Redefining the Software Development Lifecycle in the AI Era**

---

##  Overview
AICa (AI Cadence) and CodaAI are new principles and processes for **AI-first software development**.  
Just as Agile and Scrum reshaped traditional development, AICa and CodaAI aim to help engineers and tech leaders harness AI systematically, not opportunistically.  

- **AICa (AI Cadence):** A set of principles guiding AI-first development.  
- **CodaAI:** A process framework, inspired by Scrum, adapted to AI-driven code generation.  

This repository contains the **whitepaper** outlining AICa & CodaAI in detail.

---

##  Why AICa & CodaAI?
- Current AI use in development is **ad hoc and inconsistent**.  
- Prompts and contexts are treated as **throwaway**, not first-class assets.  
- AI outputs are powerful but need **structured evaluation** (fitness functions, guardrails).  
- Teams lack a **cadence** for AI adoption that integrates with CI/CD.  

AICa & CodaAI address these by making AI outputs traceable, measurable, and integrated into the software lifecycle.

##  Core Concepts

### AICa (AI Cadence) Principles
- **AI-First Mindset** → Start with *what AI can do*.  
- **AIDo (AI-Doable Tasks)** → Identify tasks suitable for AI (scaffolds, tests, docstrings).  
- **Cadence** → Maintain iterative rhythm (prefer CI/CD, short sprints if needed).  
- **Ideal vs Current State** → Define system health & measure progress.  
- **Prompt Journals** → Store prompts alongside code for traceability.  
- **Fitness Functions** → Define automated checks for quality, resilience, cost, and safety.  

### CodaAI Process
- **Roles:** Product Lead, Architect, Dev Lead, AI Wrangler, QA/SE.  
- **Ceremonies:** Planning, Prompt Planning, Continuous CodeGen Sprinting, Guardrail Review, Retro.  
- **Artifacts:** Prompt Specs, Context Packs, Codegen Contracts, Trace Logs.  
- **Metrics:** AI Acceptance Rate, Time Saved, Defect Escape Rate, Cost per Story.

##  Example Use Case
Building a booking service:  
- AI generates CRUD scaffolds + tests.  
- Dev Lead & QA validate outputs with Codegen Contracts + Fitness Functions.  
- Prompts stored in repo for future reuse and evolution.  
- Outcome: Faster delivery, traceable AI use, measurable cost savings.

---

##  Metrics to Track
- **AI Acceptance Rate** → % of AI diffs merged without rewrites.  
- **Time Saved** → Human effort delta vs baseline.  
- **Defect Escape Rate** → Bugs in AI vs human code.  
- **Cost per Story** → Token cost per completed story.  

---

## Vision
- **AICa** = Agile Manifesto for the AI era.  
- **CodaAI** = Scrum reimagined for AI-native teams.  

Together, they provide a durable foundation for engineering in the age of AI.
